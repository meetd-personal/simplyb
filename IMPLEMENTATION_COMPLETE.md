- Performance metrics (punctuality, overtime, averages)

## 🏗️ COMPLETE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### **Permission Framework**
```typescript
// 3 User Roles with hierarchical permissions
UserRole.OWNER    → 28+ permissions (full access)
UserRole.MANAGER  → 15+ permissions (operational access)
UserRole.EMPLOYEE → 6+ permissions (personal access)

// Permission categories
- Financial permissions (view totals, manage transactions)
- HR permissions (schedules, payroll, time off)
- Settings permissions (business, user, integrations)
- System permissions (business switching, team management)
```

### **Screen Architecture**
```typescript
// Role-specific screens and navigation
Owner Navigation:    Dashboard → Revenue → Expenses → Reports → Settings
Manager Navigation:  Dashboard → Transactions → Schedules → Payroll → Settings  
Employee Navigation: Dashboard → Schedule → Time Off → Pay → Profile
```

### **Data Security**
```typescript
// Automatic data filtering based on role
Owner:    All financial data + business metrics + HR data
Manager:  Activity data (no amounts) + HR management + operational metrics
Employee: Personal data only (schedule, pay, time off)
```
